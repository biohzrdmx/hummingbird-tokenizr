# hummingbird-tokenizr

Salted, SHA256-hashed token generation and checking for your Hummingbird Lite instances

## Requirements

PHP 5.2+ with the Hash extension

## Basic usage

Include the file.

Use getToken() to tokenize your data. It will return an string with the source data and its message digest:

	$token = Tokenizr::getToken('something');

You can then save the token wherever you want. To check it back, use checkToken()

	$valid = Tokenizr::checkToken('something.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx');

To get back the data, use getData()

	$data = Tokenizr::getData('something.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx');

Note that the data and its message digest are separated by a PERIOD, so it wouldn't be a good idea to try to tokenize strings containing periods (duh). Data structures (arrays/objects) aren't supported as-is, if you want to tokenize them, you'll have to serialize and/or base64-encode them before using this class.

NOTE: Since the last update you can change the divider to avoid collisions with PERIODS.

Also note that the data is saved in plain sight, THIS CLASS IS NOT DESIGNED TO ENCRYPT DATA. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to check if the data (from a cookie, for example) has been generated by your code and not forged. The checksum is reliable as long as you NEVER DISCLOSE YOUR SALTS.
